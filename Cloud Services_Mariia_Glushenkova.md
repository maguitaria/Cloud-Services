### Fly.io assignment Week 1

- # Getting Started with Django on Render
  
  ### Create Project Structure
  
  1. Use [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/basic-usage/#project-setup) to initialize your project directory:
     
     ```shell
     poetry new mysiteCreated package mysite in mysite
     cd mysitels
     README.rst     mysite         pyproject.toml tests
     
     # We don't need the code for our package that was generated by Poetry, so:
     rm -rf mysite tests
     ```
  
  2. In `pyproject.toml`, ensure the Python version requirement includes version `3.7`, which is available on Render.
     
     ```toml
     [tool.poetry.dependencies]
     python = "^3.7"
     ```
  
  3. Add Django as a dependency.
     
     ```shell
     poetry add django
     ```
  
  4. Create a Django project for your application.
  
  5. start the development server.
     
     ```shell
     poetry run ./manage.py runserver
     ```
  
  6. View architecture structure in Terminal
     
     ```shell
     maria@maguitaria-mac mysite % poetry add django
     Using version **^4.2.5** for django
     
     Updating dependencies
     
     Resolving dependencies... Downloading https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/d5/fb/a79efcab32b8a1f1ddcResolving dependencies... (0.7s)

     maria@maguitaria-mac mysite % poetry run django-admin startproject mysite .
     maria@maguitaria-mac mysite % ls -la
     
     total 24
     
     drwxr-xr-x    7 maria  staff   224 Sep 18 14:23 .

     ```

```
Then I started to continue tutroial by creating a poll ap from django website.

## Write your first view[¶](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/intro/tutorial01/#write-your-first-view "Permalink to this headline")

Let’s write the first view. Open the file `polls/views.py` and put the following Python code in it:

`polls/views.py`[¶](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/intro/tutorial01/#id1 "Permalink to this code")

This is the simplest view possible in Django. To call the view, we need to map it to a URL - and for this we need a URLconf.
```

### Questions for Week 1

1. **SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS**
   
   - **SaaS (Software as a Service):** It's like using software through a web browser, such as Gmail or Microsoft 365.
   
   - **PaaS (Platform as a Service):** It's a platform for developers to build and run apps without worrying about the underlying infrastructure, like Heroku.

## Course Week 2: Questions

### Questions for Week 2

**Difference within Saas/ Paas/ Iaas**

1. <u>Saas is a software as a Service.</u> It is a way to deliver applications remotely over the Internet instead of locally on machines.You can use cloud-based apps which are hosted on cloud providers like AWS, Azure etc. Users are responsible for managing and maintaining the operating system, applications, and data on the virtual machines.

<u>IaaS is suitable for users who need</u> more control over the underlying infrastructure, such as system administrators and developers who want to configure and manage their own servers.

2. <u>Paaas is a platform as a Service. </u>It is used mainly by developers.Servers like Heroku, Google App Engine are examples.

3. <u>Saas is a Software as a Service.</u> It is a fully functional software app on a subscription basis. Saas is for end-users who want ready software solutions without managing them.Examples include email services like Gmail and productivity tools like Microsoft Office 365.

4. ![Understanding Azure PaaS vs. IaaS vs. SaaS - Applied Information Sciences](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/j1JxiEckDDwuV98992YrBHgiNor6E7lRGUibQhH3-MxcTcB3XbwUOUzL88P3TahqoKw04Q-AYx-UiXA9UUxaM8ASJF3CkMjx2NJWFu1n1xgptbVozE1brtAuZ_Hfb5NKBRZn_teVzmYl_C2PnhhVmsU)
- Explain what is serverless architecture?

is a cloud computing model where the cloud provider manages the infrastructure and automatically allocates resources as needed to run and scale applications. In a serverless architecture, developers can focus primarily on writing code to implement specific functions or services without dealing with server provisioning, maintenance, or scaling concerns.

- When it is more feasible solution to use application containers (app virtualization) than full OS virtualization to provide networked services?

- Containers are ideal for easy deployment and management purposes. They are easy to package,deploy and manage with Kubernetes etc. They provide automatic scaling, load balancing.

- Cost-efficient

However, it is not a good option in case you have a legacy application/ you need isolation requirements.Also, Applications with complex software stacks cannot be easily containerized and may  benefit from running within virtual machines, where each VM can have its own OS and dependencies. 

### Week 2: Codemagic.io application build

Install any common mobile development environment (such as Kotlin, Flutter, React Native, .NET MAUI, etc. See [the supported platforms here](https://codemagic.io/start/)). Use [Codemagic.io](https://codemagic.io/) to build, test and deploy your application.

- Use your own or some existing mobile application repository. Some [sample projects here](https://docs.codemagic.io/yaml-quick-start/codemagic-sample-projects/)

- Use codemagic to build your application

- Codemagic [pricing is here](https://codemagic.io/pricing/). It’s free for small hobby project use / trialing

- Document your work progress with few screenshots to the learning diary

- Record a short screencast demo video (with [OBS](https://obsproject.com/) or whatever recording software you prefer) about your mobile application and upload it to the Youtube (or some other video service) as unlisted video where hidden link points to your demo video, and no login is required, but video is not necessary completely public. Keep the video there until you have received your course grade.

- Write the video address to the learning diary so that your peer reviewers can verify it easily
1. Created an account and Github repository to set up an application for React Native IOS/Android

2. Forked a sample project repo for React native app with ready codemagic.yaml

3. Added a new Cloud service account in Google Play, adjusted YAML for that. 

4. Initialized env variables.

Outcome: I tried to

1. Build an APK using react native Android build

2. Deploy to Google Play, but it required subscription which was not the best solution (25$)

3. Deploy to fdroid (open-source deployment app), which was unsuccessful on account of many requirements.

Outstanding video about Iaas/Paas/Saas

[What are the Business Benefits of Cloud Computing, IaaS, PaaS and SaaS? - YouTube](https://youtu.be/whkyRvugqlM?si=nCc2lRdTFGqBiA7C)

> Describe reasons why so many (most?) companies are using cloud based email and calendar services
> 
> Cloud based services are reliable, fast, secure and easily scalable.
> 
> The automatic updates, backup, and disaster recovery capabilities further enhance productivity and peace of mind.
> 
> What would a mid-size company store to the Amazon Glacier? What not? Why? What other large cloud backup or mass storage providers are there?
> 
> ---
> 
> Amazon Glacier is mainly used for storing large amount of data which need to be rarely retrieved (confidential secure large data info, history versions, backups of critical data). These files are then stored as an archive in Glacier.
> 
> Amazon Glacier is not a good choice for files which need instand and speedy, frequent retrieval. For  those purposes consider using Block storage or EFS as they are created specifically for quick operations.
> 
> Alternative large cloud backup and mass storage providers include:
> 
> 1. **Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service):** Amazon S3 offers scalable and durable object storage designed for frequently accessed data. It's suitable for active storage needs.
> 
> 2. **Microsoft Azure Blob Storage:** Microsoft Azure provides scalable object storage with different tiers, including cold and archive storage, similar to Amazon Glacier.
> 
> 3. **Google Cloud Storage:** Google Cloud offers multi-tiered storage options, including nearline and coldline storage, suitable for archival data.

> *The Lowdown:* A Republican-party backed big data firm, [Deep Root Analytics, put personal information and voter profiling data at risk](http://www.zdnet.com/article/security-lapse-exposes-198-million-united-states-voter-records/) by storing them on a wide-open S3 server. The treasure trove of information combined publicly accessible voter information with additional market research data to come up with matrices about individual voters as to the likelihood of their voting behavior in coming elections.
> 
> **Verizon Data Exposure (2017):
> 
> - **What Went Wrong:** In July 2017, an independent security researcher discovered a misconfigured Amazon S3 bucket containing data belonging to Verizon, one of the largest telecommunications companies in the world. The exposed data included confidential and sensitive information about Verizon customers and internal systems(more than 2 million people). The misconfiguration occurred due to an error in permissions settings.
> 1. **Amazon S3 Bucket Finder:** This is an open-source tool that allows you to search for publicly accessible Amazon S3 buckets by using common naming conventions. It helps identify potentially vulnerable buckets and provides a list of discovered buckets.
> 
> 2. **Bisect:** Bisect is a tool that scans Amazon S3 buckets for misconfigurations and public access. It uses a list of common bucket names and checks their status to identify accessible buckets.

### Setup a website providing static contents from AWS S3 bucket : Week 3

> - Use normal commercial AWS account or create a new free tier trial AWS account. New AWS account activation may take a day or so. AWS education accounts may also work.
> - Use Amazon S3 bucket as web server and setup some static and basic “hello world” website there. Remember to destroy the S3 bucket if unused.
> - Document your work progress with few screenshots to the learning diary
> - Record a short screencast demo video (with [OBS](https://obsproject.com/) or whatever recording software you prefer) about your S3 web site and upload it to the Youtube (or some other video service) as unlisted video where hidden link points to your demo video, and no login is required, but video is not necessary completely public. Keep the video there until you have received your course grade.

[What is Amazon S3? - Amazon Simple Storage Service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/Welcome.html)

###### Step 1: Create your first S3 bucket

[Getting Started&nbsp;– Amazon Simple Storage Service&nbsp;(S3)&nbsp;– AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/ru/s3/getting-started/)

Followed tutorial and set up default bucket.

![](/Users/maria/Library/Application%20Support/marktext/images/2023-09-20-13-55-00-image.png)

###### Step 2:  Enabling website hosting

<img src="file:///Users/maria/Library/Application%20Support/marktext/images/2023-09-20-14-08-35-image.png" title="" alt="" width="419">

![](/Users/maria/Library/Application%20Support/marktext/images/2023-09-20-14-09-47-image.png)

Under **Static website hosting**, note the **Endpoint**.

The **Endpoint** is the Amazon S3 website endpoint for your bucket. After you finish configuring your bucket as a static website, you can use this endpoint to test your website.

###### Step 3:  Configuring an index document

Decided to add a folder of WIld Rydes previous deployment tutorial for [Tutorial for building a Web Application with Amazon S3, Lambda, DynamoDB and API Gateway - DEV Community](https://dev.to/connor11528/tutorial-for-building-a-web-application-with-amazon-s3-lambda-dynamodb-and-api-gateway). When I access URL of my index.html, I get the html website workin`!

Of crs, I uploaded this folder to the S3 bucket and then clicked "Object URL"

![](/Users/maria/Library/Application%20Support/marktext/images/2023-09-20-14-24-22-image.png)

###### # Setting permissions for website access

When you configure a bucket as a static website, if you want your website to be public, you can grant public read access. To make your bucket publicly readable, you must disable block public access settings for the bucket and write a bucket policy that grants public read access. If your bucket contains objects that are not owned by the bucket owner, you might also need to add an object access control list (ACL) that grants everyone read access.

![](/Users/maria/Library/Application%20Support/marktext/images/2023-09-20-14-30-00-image.png)

Amazon S3 turns off Block Public Access settings for your bucket. So, now it is accessible for everybody.

###### Step 7: Add a bucket policy

To make the objects in your bucket publicly readable, you must write a bucket policy that grants everyone `s3:GetObject` permission.

Remember to specify the `Resource` with your ARN bucket name AND /* ( if you want that users have access to all cloud files) [amazon web services - S3 Bucket action doesnt apply to any resources - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44228422/s3-bucket-action-doesnt-apply-to-any-resources)

![](/Users/maria/Library/Application%20Support/marktext/images/2023-09-20-14-36-07-image.png)

###### (Optional) Logging web traffic

###### To enable server access logging for your static website bucket

1. Open the Amazon S3 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/.

2. In the same Region where you created the bucket that is configured as a static website, create a bucket for logging, for example `logs.example.com`.

3. Create a folder for the server access logging log files (for example, `logs`).

4. (Optional) If you want to use CloudFront to improve your website performance, create a folder for the CloudFront log files (for example, `cdn`).
   
   For more information, see [Speeding up your website with Amazon CloudFront](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/website-hosting-cloudfront-walkthrough.html).

5. In the **Buckets** list, choose your bucket.

6. Choose **Properties**.

7. Under **Server access logging**, choose **Edit**.

8. Choose **Enable**.

![](/Users/maria/Library/Application%20Support/marktext/images/2023-09-20-16-03-03-image.png)

This is already configured bucket with logs:

#### Course Week 5

##### Robotic Process Automation (RPA) assignment. (Free task L)



<mark>I would like to go to foobar restaurant menu and download today`s menu automatically.</mark>

This is a script for that, and please see my YOutube video and GitHub repo with sample.

#### Instructions for developing script

1. Install Puppeteer: If you haven't already, you can install Puppeteer using npm:

`npm install puppeteer`

2. Create a JavaScript script to automate the website interaction. Below is a sample script that navigates to the website, clicks a button, and then extracts and downloads the information:

```javascript
const puppeteer = require("puppeteer");
const fs = require("fs");

(async () => {
  // Launch a headless browser instance
  const browser = await puppeteer.launch();
  const page = await browser.newPage();

  // Navigate to the webpage
  await page.goto("https://fi.jamix.cloud/apps/menu/?anro=93077&k=48&mt=89");


await page.evaluate(() => {
  Array.from(document.querySelectorAll("span"))
    .filter((li) => {
      return li.innerText == "English"; // filter il for specific text
    })
    .forEach((element) => {
      if (element) element.click(); // click on il with specific text
    });
});
 
  // Save a snapshot of the webpage in MHTML format
  const cdp = await page.target().createCDPSession();
  const { data } = await cdp.send("Page.captureSnapshot", { format: "mhtml" });
  fs.writeFileSync("page.mhtml", data);
  console.log("MHTML snapshot saved");

  // Set the dimensions of the viewport (the visible part of the web page)
  await page.setViewport({ width: 1920, height: 1080 });

  // Take a screenshot and save it to a file
  await page.screenshot({ path: "screenshot.png" }); // You can specify the file name and format
  console.log("Screenshot saved as 'screenshot.png'");

  // Extract and save the text content of the webpage
  const extractedText = await page.$eval("*", (el) => el.innerText);
  fs.writeFileSync("./foodoo_menu.txt", extractedText);
  console.log("Text content saved as 'foodoo_menu.txt'");

  // Close the browser
  await browser.close();
})();

```



3. Run the script:

bashCopy code

`node your-script.js`

The script will open a headless browser, navigate to the specified webpage, click the button, wait for data to load, extract the data, and save it to a file named `downloaded_data.txt`.

![](/Users/maria/Library/Application%20Support/marktext/images/2023-10-12-00-15-52-image.png)

Also researched a lil bit on the docs pages about locators, because this info is really vital when dealing with headless browser testing/ automation.

##### 1. Choosing a VPS Server Provider and Features:

When you're selecting a Virtual Private Server (VPS) provider and considering the features, there are several important factors to keep in mind.

For instance, you should think about the server's performance, like how much processing power (CPU) and memory (RAM) it has. Some providers like DigitalOcean offer different server plans with varying levels of performance, so you'll want to choose one that matches your needs.

It's also crucial to look at where the provider's data centers are located. This matters because it affects how fast your website or application will load for users in different parts of the world. AWS, for example, has data centers in many places, so it's good for a global audience.

Consider how easy it is to upgrade your server as your project grows. AWS's Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) is an example of a service that makes this easy.

Pay close attention to the pricing structure and any hidden fees. Some providers might charge extra for things like data transfer, so you want to understand the full cost. Linode, on the other hand, is known for being transparent about its pricing.

Think about customer support and uptime as well. You'd want a provider that offers good customer support in case you run into problems. Google Cloud Platform (GCP) is known for providing 24/7 support and a reliable uptime guarantee.

Security is another critical factor. Does the provider offer features like firewalls and DDoS protection? AWS provides robust security features, including something called AWS Shield, which helps protect against DDoS attacks.

Also, consider the user interface. Is it easy to use? DigitalOcean's control panel is known for being user-friendly.

Lastly, check if the provider has a strong community and lots of documentation. This can be really helpful when you're trying to set up and manage your server. DigitalOcean, for example, has an active community and lots of tutorials.

##### 2. Hybrid Cloud Computing: Benefits, Risks, and Challenges:

Hybrid cloud computing has some advantages but also comes with its own set of challenges.

On the plus side, it's flexible, which means you can use a mix of your own servers and the cloud based on what's best for your needs. It's also scalable, meaning you can easily expand or shrink your resources as necessary. For example, you can use the public cloud for busy periods and your own servers during quieter times.

This flexibility can save you money, but you have to be careful with the complexity. Managing a hybrid setup can get tricky because you're dealing with different systems. Security is also a concern, especially when you're moving data between your servers and the cloud. You have to make sure everything is properly encrypted and protected.

Compliance is another challenge. Different industries have regulations about how data is stored and handled, and it can be tough to navigate all of these rules in a hybrid environment.

Additionally, keeping an eye on costs can be a challenge. If you're not careful, you might end up spending more than you need to. So, while hybrid cloud computing offers a lot of benefits, it's essential to plan carefully to avoid potential pitfalls.

##### 3. HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 Speeding Up Web Cloud Services:

HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 are new versions of the HTTP protocol that make websites and web applications load faster.

They do this by allowing multiple things to happen at once. Think of it like a conveyor belt at a factory. In the past, it could only carry one item at a time. That's like the old HTTP/1.1. But with HTTP/2 and HTTP/3, the conveyor belt can carry multiple items simultaneously. This means web pages with lots of pictures and text can load much quicker.

Also, these new protocols make the information that's sent between your computer and the server smaller. It's like sending a letter with fewer words – it gets there faster. And they can even prioritize what gets sent first, so the most important parts of a web page show up quickly.

##### 4. HTTP Protocol Adaptation Rates:

It's important to know how many websites and services are using these new HTTP versions. As of my last update in September 2021, HTTP/2 had become quite popular, especially among big websites and browsers. More and more websites were starting to use it because it made things faster.

HTTP/3 was also getting attention, but not as quickly. It takes some time for everyone to switch to a new technology. There might have been more adoption since then, so it's a good idea to check the latest statistics to see how things are progressing.

##### 5. HTTP Long Polling vs. Websockets for Interactive Web Applications:

When it comes to interactive web applications, there are two main ways to make them work: HTTP Long Polling and Websockets.

Imagine you're chatting with a friend online. With HTTP Long Polling, it's like sending a message and then constantly checking your inbox to see if your friend replied. This can be a bit slow because you're always asking, "Did you reply? Did you reply?" But it's easy to set up, and it works with most web browsers.

On the other hand, Websockets are like having a phone call with your friend. You talk, they talk – it's a real-time conversation. This is super fast because you don't have to keep asking if they replied. But it's a bit more complicated to set up, and not all web browsers support it.

So, the choice between Long Polling and Websockets depends on what you need. Long Polling is easier, but slower. Websockets are faster, but trickier to set up. You have to decide what's more important for your web application.
