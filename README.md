This is a repo for my documentation on CLoud Services Course. Accomplished A LOT of tasks and recorded 5 Youtube videos with detailed description of my implementation.
# Cloud Services Course README

## Course Description

This README provides an overview of the Cloud Services course offered by Oulu University of Applied Sciences (OAMK), which was completed as the second course in the curriculum. In this course, students were exposed to various aspects of cloud computing and cloud services, covering a wide range of topics and practical hands-on experiences.

## Major Tasks

The Cloud Services course at OAMK was designed to equip students with the knowledge and skills necessary to work with cloud technologies effectively. Some of the major tasks and topics covered in the course include:

1. **AWS Deployment:** Learned how to deploy applications and services on Amazon Web Services (AWS), one of the leading cloud service providers. This involved creating virtual machines (EC2 instances), setting up security groups, and configuring network services like Amazon VPC.

2. **GitHub Actions:** Understanding the fundamentals of continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) was a crucial part of the course.Automates  testing and deployment processes of my [Movieland](https://github.com/maguitaria/movieland) project.

3. **Puppeteer Automation:** This course delved into the realm of web scraping and automation using Puppeteer, a Node.js library that provides a high-level API to control headless browsers. Learned how to automate web interactions and gather data from websites.

4. **IaaS/PaaS/SaaS Services:** A core component of the course was to differentiate between Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS) offerings. Students gained insights into how these cloud service models are applied in real-world scenarios.
5. **Computer vision:**  Learning AI and usage of it in picture analysis.
